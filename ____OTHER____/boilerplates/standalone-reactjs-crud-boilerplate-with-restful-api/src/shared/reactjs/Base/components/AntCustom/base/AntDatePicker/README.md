# Overview

The `AntDatePicker` provides a custom integration for the Ant Design DatePicker component to ensure compatibility with internal configurations and Day.js instances. It resolves issues related to differing Day.js instances used by Ant Design and internal packages, such as configuration mismatches (e.g., i18n).
